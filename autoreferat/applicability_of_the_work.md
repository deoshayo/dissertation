## Applicability of the work

<!-- předpokládané další využití výsledků práce -->

The practical applicability of our work stems from the software we developed.
We made both the matchmakers and the data processing tools available as open source software.
The software is thus open to reuse and adaptation.
In this way, we contributed back to the open source ecosystem from which we drawn tools to build on.
However, while the data processing tools were designed to be reusable, the matchmakers are tied with our evaluation protocol, so they would need to be reworked for reuse.
If adapted, matchmakers can be integrated with practical applications for managing public contracts, such as with our prototype described in @Mynarz2014b, or with [zInfo.cz](https://www.zinfo.cz), a Czech platform for public contracts maintained by Datlab s.r.o.
