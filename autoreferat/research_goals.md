<!-- Goals -->

Our research goal is to explore matchmaking of public contracts to bidders operating on linked open data.
In particular, we want to explore what methods can be adopted for this task and discover the most salient factors influencing the quality of matchmaking, with a specific focus on what linked open data enables.
In order to pursue this goal we prepare public procurement linked open data and develop software for matchmaking.
Our secondary target implied by our research direction is to test the available implementations of the semantic web technologies for handling linked open data and, if these tools are found lacking, to develop auxiliary tools to support data preparation and matchmaking.
These secondary goals were not formulated upfront; we only specified them explicitly as we progressed the pursuit of our primary goal.

<!-- Prerequisites -->

In order to be able to deliver on the stated goals, their prerequisites must be fulfilled.
Applied research depends on the availability of its building blocks.
Our research is built on open data and open-source software.
We need public procurement data to be available as open data, as described in [Section @sec:open-data].
The data must be structured in a way from which a semantic description of the data can be created, implying that the data is machine-readable and consistent.
Consistency of the data arises from standardization, including the adherence to fixed schemas and code lists.
We conceive matchmaking as a high-level task based on many layers of technology.
Both our data preparation tools and matchmakers build on open-source components.
In the pursuit of our goals we reused and orchestrated a large set of existing open-source software.
