We follow a simple structure in this dissertation.
This chapter introduces our research and explains both the preliminaries and context in which our work is built as well as surveying the related research ([-@sec:related-work]) to position our contributions.
The dissertation continues with a substantial chapter on data preparation ([-@sec:data-preparation]) that describes the extensive effort we invested in pre-processing data for the purposes of matchmaking.
In line with the characteristics of linked open data, the key parts of this chapter deal with linking ([-@sec:linking]) and data fusion ([-@sec:fusion]).
We follow up with a principal chapter that describes the matchmaking methods we designed and implemented ([-@sec:methods]), which includes matchmaking based on SPARQL ([-@sec:method-sparql]) and on tensor factorization by RESCAL ([-@sec:method-rescal]).
The subsequent chapter discusses the evaluation ([-@sec:evaluation]) of the devised matchmaking methods by using the datasets we prepared.
We experimented with many configurations of the matchmaking methods in the evaluation.
In this chapter, we present the results of selected quantitative evaluation metrics and provide interpretations of the obtained results.
Finally, the concluding chapter ([-@sec:conclusions]) closes the dissertation, summarizing its principal contributions as well as remarking on its limitations that may be addresses in future research.
