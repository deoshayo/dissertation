<!-- struktura a obsah prÃ¡ce -->

The dissertation follows a simple structure. 
We start by introducing our research and explain both the preliminaries and context of our work, as well as surveying the related research to position our contributions.
The dissertation continues with a substantial chapter on data preparation that describes the extensive effort we invested in pre-processing data for the purposes of matchmaking.
The key parts of this chapter deal with techniques for linking and data fusion we used.
We follow up with a principal chapter that describes the matchmaking methods we designed and implemented; including matchmaking via SPARQL and tensor factorization by RESCAL.
The subsequent chapter discusses the evaluation of the devised matchmaking methods by using the datasets we prepared.
Here, we present and interpret the results of the selected quantitative evaluation metrics. 
Finally, the concluding chapter closes the dissertation, summarizing its principal contributions as well as remarking on its limitations to be addressed in future research.
