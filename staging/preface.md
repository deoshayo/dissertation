# Preface

The chosen topic is firmly grounded in the research direction of the Department of Information and Knowledge Engineering (DIKE) at the University of Economics in Prague where our work was conducted.
Our research builds both on linked data and data mining, uniting the principal areas researched at DIKE.
Linked data is a pervasive part of our work, manifest in the data preparation as well as in the SPARQL-based matchmakers.
Data mining surfaces in our application of tensor factorization via RESCAL for matchmaking.
The adopted topic constitutes a natural continuation of this dissertation author's prior work with linked open data since 2009.
The topic was originally formulated as part of the LOD2,^[<http://lod2.eu>] a 7^th^ Framework Programme EU research project on linked open data, which funded our work from 2011 to 2014.
