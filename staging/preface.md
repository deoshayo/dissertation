# Preface {.unnumbered}

I started with two vague assumptions driving my research.
First, linked open data can serve as a better infrastructure for online markets.
Second, matchmakers operating in this infrastructure can remove some friction from conducting business transactions in the markets, thereby making the market allocation more efficient.
What I needed to play with these ideas was a market in which data on both supply and demand is available.
Public procurement market offers a feature few other markets have: demands are explicitly represented as data in the form of public procurement notices thanks to their proactive disclosure as open data mandated by law.
Moreover, as a domain fraught with numerous data quality issues, public procurement presents a great opportunity to remedy the issues with the technologies of linked data, also known as the semantic web stack.
My work began.

While some experts disagree on the value of the linked open data, industry adopted it into its toolbox

Linked open data promises apparent societal benefits of transparency through data integration.
A key idea: linked open data as an infrastructure for a distributed marketplace
matchmaking as a "killer application" of linked data
more efficient way to do business
research in this dissertation is a probe in that direction

I worked with linked open data since 2009.
It all started with the LOD2 project.
Late in 2010 we started to discuss joining the LOD2 project.
This project set to deliver a software stack for working with linked open data.
Our responsibility was to extend and deploy the software for a distributed marketplace for public sector contracts.

We proposed to use linked open data for a distributed marketplace of public contracts.
matchmaking for an economic impact of open data
LOD2 since 2011
In order to be able to work on the LOD2 project I enrolled at the University of Economics, Prague as a Ph.D. student and set up to pursue the goals of this dissertation.
A jigsaw falling into its place.

The chosen topic is firmly grounded in the research direction of the Department of Information and Knowledge Engineering (DIKE) at the University of Economics in Prague where our work was conducted.
Our research builds both on linked data and data mining, uniting the principal areas researched at DIKE.
Linked data is a pervasive part of our work, manifest in the data preparation as well as in the SPARQL-based matchmakers.
Data mining surfaces in our application of tensor factorization via RESCAL for matchmaking.
The adopted topic constitutes a natural continuation of this dissertation author's prior work with linked open data since 2009.
The topic was originally formulated as part of the LOD2,^[<http://lod2.eu>] a 7^th^ Framework Programme EU research project on linked open data, which funded our work from 2011 to 2014.
