### Linked datasets

We linked several datasets with the Czech public procurement register.
In this section we describe how these datasets were prepared.
The [@fig:cloud] shows how these datasets are linked.
In this diagram, dataset size corresponds to the number of RDF triples in the dataset, while the thickness of lines between the datasets corresponds to the number of links connecting them.
Both proportions are logarithmically scaled for display purposes.
