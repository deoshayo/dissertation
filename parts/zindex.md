## zIndex

[zIndex](http://zindex.cz/en) provides Czech contracting authorities with fairness scores.
The scores are based on the contracting authority's adherence to good practices in public procurement.
As its authors suggest, high zIndex score implies there is less room for mismanagement of public funds.

[zIndex's wiki](http://wiki.zindex.cz/doku.php?id=en:kvalita_dat_ve_vestniku) documents many of the data quality problems with the Czech public procurement register.

zIndex scores were provided to the author by Datlab s.r.o. in 2014.
<!-- TODO: Ask for more up-to-date versions of the scores or discard zIndex completely? -->
