### zIndex

[zIndex](http://zindex.cz/en) grades Czech contracting authorities with fairness scores.
The scores are based on the contracting authority's adherence to good practices in public procurement as observed in the data it discloses ([Soudek, 2016](#Soudek2016b)).
As its authors suggest, high zIndex score implies there is less room for mismanagement of public funds.
The index is produced by the Centre for Applied Economics at the Faculty of Social Sciences, Charles University in Prague.

zIndex is linked to contracting authorities via their Registered Identification Numbers.
The scores are available for 4989 contracting authorities.
<!-- TODO: Add the percentage of contracting authorities, for which zIndex is known. -->

zIndex scores were initially supplied to the author by [Datlab s.r.o.](http://datlab.cz) in 2014.
An updated snapshot of zIndex was provided upon request in early 2017.
