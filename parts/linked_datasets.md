## Linked datasets

We linked several datasets with the Czech public procurement register.
In this section we describe how these datasets were prepared.
A diagram showing how these datasets are linked is shown in [@fig:cloud].
Dataset size corresponds to the number of triples in the dataset, while the thickness of lines between datasets corresponds to the number of links; both proportions are logarithmically scaled.
