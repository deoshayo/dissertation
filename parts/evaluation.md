# Evaluation

Experimental design (experimental evaluation, controlled experiment)
- Lab studies
- Matchmaking is a classification task that produces a ranked list of relevant items.

Nonexperimental design: qualitative research via interviews with users (or domain experts)

+ Descriptive evaluation via example scenarios?
+ Cost-benefit analysis discussing the matchmaker's value compared with the costs in sustaining it (keeping it operable)?

Statistical significance
Practical importance: demonstrate utility of the developed artefact

Alternative evaluation protocol, widely used in top-k recommendation: <http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1864721>

Evaluated dimensions:
* Effectiveness (quality)
* Efficiency (speed)
  - Additional indices may speed up retrieval.
  - Complexity of the distance function.
    - Blocking may be done by lower-bounding distance functions. Such functions are less complex and produce approximate lower distance.
