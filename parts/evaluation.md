# Evaluation

Experimental design (experimental evaluation, controlled experiment)
- Lab studies
- Matchmaking is a classification task that produces a ranked list of relevant items.

Nonexperimental design: qualitative research via interviews with users (or domain experts)

+ Descriptive evaluation via example scenarios?
+ Cost-benefit analysis discussing the matchmaker's value compared with the costs in sustaining it (keeping it operable)?

Statistical significance
Practical importance: demonstrate utility of the developed artefact
