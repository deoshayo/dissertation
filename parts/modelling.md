### Modelling

Semantic data model
The goal of data modelling is to make the data amenable to matchmaking.
Modelling in RDF is typically not guided by the expected use of the modelled data. (Agnostic of use)
RDF supports a wide array of ways to reuse data.
Instead, it is guided by a conceptual model.

Focus on querying instead of reasoning
Features of OWL were not needed.
Focus on data integration
Any RDF datasets can be merged. (Syntactically)
RDF makes further data processing straightforward.

The data in the Czech public procurement register is represented using forms.
Forms are documents that inform about public contracts.
For example, these forms include prior information notices or contract award notices.
Using the terminology of the semantic web, the forms are information resources.

Also display computed cardinalities.
This can be used for visual validation of the ETL's results.
