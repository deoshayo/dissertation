## Comparison of the results

<!-- Compare the results of SPARQL-based and RESCAL-based matchmakers. -->

<!--
Overall, the RESCAL-based matchmakers produce results with very low diversity, especially when considering their CC@10.
The low diversity means that they tend to recommend the same bidders repeatedly.
