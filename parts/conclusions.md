Main contributions:

* Development of matchmaking methods
* Implementation of matchmaking methods or application of existing implementation (i.e. Web of Needs)
* Rigorous evaluation of the methods
* Documentation of the methods
* Cleaned and enriched Czech public procurement dataset published as linked open data for anyone to reuse
* Reusable command-line tools for working with RDF data

<!--
New findings compared with the state of the art

Our work perhaps produced more value in the developed reusable tools for data preparation and matchmaking than as a use case in public procurement.
