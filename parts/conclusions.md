Main contributions:

* Development of matchmaking methods
* Implementation of matchmaking methods or application of existing implementation (i.e. Web of Needs)
* Rigorous evaluation of the methods
* Documentation of the methods
* Cleaned and enriched Czech public procurement dataset published as linked open data for anyone to reuse
* Reusable command-line tools for working with RDF data

We explored only a few ways of matchmaking public contracts to bidders.
Many more ways of relevance engineering are left open to pursue and assess their worth.

<!--
Linked open data is raw data.

We found the SPARQL-based matchmaking to be superior. (TODO: update)
- Is there any reason to use RESCAL-based matchmaking?

New findings compared with the state of the art

Evaluation with reduced data confirmed that *"simple models and a lot of data trump more elaborate models based on less data"* [@Halevy2009, p. 9].

Ultimately, our work perhaps produced greater value in the developed reusable artefacts for data preparation and matchmaking than as a use case in public procurement.
