The Web of Needs^[<https://github.com/researchstudio-sat/webofneeds>] project by Research Studios Austria states that its *"overall goal is to create a decentralized infrastructure that allows people to publish documents on the Web which make it possible to contact each other"* [@Kleedorfer2013].
Members of the project implemented a prototypical implementation of matchmaking based on Sindice SIREn^[<http://www.sindicetech.com/siren.html>] search engine.

German national project *IntelligentMatch* (2010 â€” 2012)^[<http://www.intelligent-match.de>] set as its goal to build up technological infrastructure for intelligent matchmaking.
Among the results of this project is *i-text*, a prototype of matchmaking engine targeted at the textile industry.

Matchmaking dates back to 1990s (e.g., <https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/95-1/Papers/088.pdf>).
- Based e.g., on KQML
- Declarative forward-chaining rules

Description logics: query is formulated as a class of matches
- Matches tested via subsumption (or satisfiability of constraints)

Combination of logical and statistical inference delivers superior results when compared with matchmaking based only on logical inference.
