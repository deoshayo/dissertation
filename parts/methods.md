# Matchmaking methods

<!--
Interoperability based on common data model.
If data follows the model described in the chapter on data preparation, the developed matchmakers can be applied to it.
-->

Limitation: Our approach works as a one-shot recommendation
Is there a way to provide user feedback?

<!--
Formalization of the methods should be provided.
We can start with a definition of the key entities involved in the matchmaking task.
-->

<!-- TODO: Add a diagram showing the technology stack involved in the matchmaker. -->
