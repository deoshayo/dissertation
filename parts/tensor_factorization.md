## Tensor factorization

<!--
### Implementation notes:

* Start a new Python project `matchmaker-rescal`.
* Only command-line interface (~ minimum viable product)
* Produce results in EDN (<https://github.com/swaroopch/edn_format>).

<!--
Tensors are multidimensional arrays. A natural way to represent multi-graphs is to use adjacency tensors.
Tensor order
RDF data can be represented as a third-order tensor.
Adjacency tensors
Slices
Fibers
Tensor factorization
Latent factors

Dealing with the noise in the data
Perspective of probabilistic databases

Hybrid approaches combining multiple methods
- E.g., re-ranking

Tensor factorization ~ tensor completion

<!--
RESCAL does not require strict feature modelling.

<!--
Comparison of CBR systems with machine learning is in [@Richter2013, p. 531].
CBR and ML have many things in common.
Both learn from past data to produce predictions, which are not guaranteed to be correct.
