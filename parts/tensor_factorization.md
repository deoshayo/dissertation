## Tensor factorization

<!--
### Implementation notes:

* Start a new Python project `matchmaker-rescal`.
* Only command-line interface (~ minimum viable product)
* Produce results in EDN (<https://github.com/swaroopch/edn_format>).

Web of Needs

<!--
Tensors are multidimensional arrays. A natural way to represent multi-graphs is to use adjacency tensors.
Tensor order
RDF data can be represented as a third-order tensor.
Adjacency tensors
Slices
Fibers
Tensor factorization
Latent factors

Dealing with the noise in the data
Perspective of probabilistic databases

Hybrid approaches combining multiple methods
- E.g., re-ranking

<!--
RESCAL does not require strict feature modelling.
