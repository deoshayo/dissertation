# Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}

I would like to thank my supervisor doc. Ing. Vojtěch Svátek, Dr. for creating an environment in which this research could have been done and for helping me navigate the mazes of academia.
Completing this dissertation would also not be feasible without developers of open-source software, whom I want to thank for sharing their work.
I am grateful to dr. Tommaso di Noia, who allowed me to visit his group at the Polytechnic University of Bari, Italy.
During this internship, Tommaso helped me to clarify the relation of my topic to recommender systems.
Vito Claudio Ostuni, then one of Tommaso's Ph.D. students, suggested looking into case-base reasoning, which provided my work with a useful conceptual framework.
My thanks also goes to RNDr. Jakub Klímek, Ph.D. from the Czech Technical University for his help with data preparation, and to PhDr. Ing. Jiří Skuhrovec, Ph.D. from Datlab s.r.o. for supplying me with the zIndex data as well as insights into the public procurement domain.
A special thanks belongs to my friends and family, who helped me stay sane during the long years of my Ph.D. endeavour.

The research presented in this thesis was partially supported by the EU ICT FP7 project no. 257943 (LOD2 project) and by the H2020 project no. 645833 (OpenBudgets.eu).
