# Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}

I would like to thank my supervisor doc. Ing. Vojtěch Svátek, Dr. for creating an environment in which this research could have been done.
I am grateful to dr. Tommaso di Noia, who allowed me to visit his group at the Polytechnic University of Bari, Italy.
During this internship, Tommaso helped me to understand the relation of my topic to recommender systems.
Vito Claudio Ostuni, then one of Tommaso's Ph.D. students, suggested looking into case-base reasoning, which provided my work useful conceptual framework.
My thanks also goes to RNDr. Jakub Klímek, Ph.D. from the Czech Technical University for his extensive help with data preparation.

The research presented in this thesis was partially supported by the EU ICT FP7 project no. 257943 (LOD2 project) and by the H2020 project no. 645833 (OpenBudgets.eu).
