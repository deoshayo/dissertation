# Matchmaking methods

*"Matchmaking is generally defined as the ranking of a set of offers according to a request"* ([Agarwal, Lamparter, 2005](#Agarwal2005)).
Matchmaking is defined as *"the process of searching the space of possible matches between demand and supplies"* ([Di Noia et al., 2004, p. 9](#DiNoia2004)).
*"Matchmaking is an information retrieval task whereby queries (a.k.a. demands) and resources (a.k.a. supplies) are expressed using semi-structured data in the form of advertisements, and task results are ordered (ranked) lists of those resources best fulfilling the query"* ([Di Noia, Di Sciascio, Donini, 2007, p. 278](#DiNoia2007)).
*"the objective of a matchmaking process is to discover best available offers to a given request"* ([Di Noia, Di Sciascio, Donini, 2007, p. 269](#DiNoia2007))
*"Semantic matchmaking is a matchmaking task whereby queries and resources advertisements are expressed  with reference to a shared specification of a conceptualization for the knowledge domain at hand, i.e., an         ontology"* ([Di Noia, Di Sciascio, Donini, 2007, p. 270](#DiNoia2007))

In matchmaking *"the choice of which is the data, and which is the query depends just on the point of view"* ([Di Noia et al., 2004](#DiNoia2004)).
Both data describing supply and data about demand can be turned either into queries or into queried data.
To illustrate the inverse direction, matchmaking can provide, for example, alerts to companies about relevant business opportunities in public procurement. 

Viewed as an information retrieval problem, the process of matchmaking can be thus considered as rewriting demands or offers to executable queries.

Is there a way to provide user feedback?
