## Case-based recommender systems

Cold start problem of case-based recommenders

The matchmaker learns from interactions between contracting authorities and bidders
A contract is an explicit specification of user's needs.

Similarly to collaborative recommendation approaches, case-based recommenders exploit data about past behaviour.
Collaborative recommender systems: explicit offers (product or services) + demand behaviour (user interactions)
Our case-based recommender: explicit demands (contracts) + offer behaviour (histories of bidders)

Contract award can be interpreted an implicit rating of the awarded bidder.
The histories of bidders are held in memory instead of a model in SPARQL-based and Elasticsearch-based matchmaking.

<!-- TODO: Explain the difference between matchmaking and recommender systems. (Notion of a query.) -->

Case-based recommendation is a kind of knowledge-based recommendation that uses similarity-based retrieval.

Query-based approaches: often users have to respecify their query in case no results are found.
Browsing-based approaches: navigation of the item space, for example using critique-based navigation
- Critiquing can be used to reformulate matchmaking queries (e.g., assign different weights) or query the results (e.g., filter to meet the critique).
