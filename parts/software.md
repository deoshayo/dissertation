# Appendix A: Software {#sec:software .unnumbered}

The work described in this thesis involved many software tools.
In order to provide a single reference point for these tools, this appendix provides their brief descriptions.
We describe both the software used for data preparation as well as software for matchmaking.
The descriptions are divided into two categories: software that we reused and software that we developed.
Descriptions in each category are sorted in alphabetic order.

## Reused software

Several tools were reused as is or integrated with other tools.
The tools listed in this category are mostly database systems or data processing tools.

### Elasticsearch

### GeoTools

### LinkedPipes-ETL

### OpenLink Virtuoso

### RESCAL

### Saxon XSLT and XQuery Processor

### Silk Link Discovery Framework

### tarql

### UnifiedViews

## Developed software

In order to cover needs that were not sufficiently addressed by existing software we developed new reusable tools.
