# Appendix A: Software {#sec:software .unnumbered} 

The work described in this thesis involved many software tools.
In order to provide a single reference point for these tools, this appendix provides their brief descriptions.
We describe both the software used for data preparation as well as software for matchmaking.
The descriptions are divided into two categories: software that we reused and software that we developed.
Descriptions in each category are sorted in alphabetic order.
