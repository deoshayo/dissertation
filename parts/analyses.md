# Data analyses

We performed several analyses of the data.
The primary purpose of these analyses was to provide feedback regarding the quality of the processed data.
We discovered several problems either in the source data or in its transformation.
For example, the source data features contracts in which the contracting authority and the awarded bidder are the same.
Such unexpected referential integrity problems typically surface only when data is used.
An example problem in data transformation was caused by constructing IRI of contract lots using non-unique keys.
IRI collisions led to inadvertent fusion of distinct resources.

The secondary purpose of these analyses was to test if the data can yield interesting findings.
We managed to find several insights that were previously covered by the media.
For example, if we looked for businesses that received most money via public contracts per day of their existence, Kratolia Trade emerged as a clear outlier, with income over 8 million CZK per day.
A search in the media revealed that the company dealing in biodiesel business was previously sued for tax evasion and later declared insolvency.
