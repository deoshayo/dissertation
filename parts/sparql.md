## SPARQL

<!--
### Implementations notes

* Start a new Clojure project `matchmaker-sparql`.
* Only command-line interface (~ minimum viable product)
* Copy and paste code from the previous matchmaker.
* Custom benchmark manipulating data in the SPARQL endpoint.
* Matchmaker is provided as a component (e.g., mount) 
* SPARQL interactions are done via the `sparclj` library.
* Extensive configuration in EDN.
* Produces results in EDN.
