<!--
* Now-defunct bidders should be filtered out.
* Match score can be normalized by the bidders age (now() - dcterms:issued).
* Contracts with more tenders (`pc:numberOfTenders`) can be scored as more telling, since the bidder won in greater competition.
* Contracts with open procedures can be also scored as more telling.
