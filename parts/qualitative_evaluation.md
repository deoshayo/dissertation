## Qualitative evaluation

<!--
TODO:
* Structured interviews with civil servants.
* Do model tasks:
  * Provide (small, randomly selected from top n+k matchmaking results) n of companies per contract and let the interviewee sort them based on their suitability for the contract. Then evaluate correlation.
  * Provide (small) n of companies per contract, let the interviewee distinguish true and false positives. Compute precision, recall, F1 measure?

Find email addresses of civil servants responsible for public procurement of the Prague city districts.
The addresses may be available in the contracting authority profiles.
Ask each civil servants for an interview. (Start with a smaller sample to avoid (the unlikely possibility of) having to turn down interviews.)
For each city district, prepare matchmaking results for several latest public contracts it awarded.
Highlight the awarded bidder in the results if found.
Ask the civil servants to sort the results based on suitability. (How? How to make sure that enough information about bidders is available?)
Ask also to reflect on the results (in terms of diversity, biases etc.).
Use the resorted results to find correlation to the matchmaker's results.

Should we rename this as "user study"? (per [@Beel2013])
