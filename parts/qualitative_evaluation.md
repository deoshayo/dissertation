<!--
TODO:
* Structured interviews with civil servants.
* Do model tasks:
  * Provide (small, randomly selected from top n+k matchmaking results) n of companies per contract and let the interviewee sort them based on their suitability for the contract. Then evaluate correlation.
  * Provide (small) n of companies per contract, let the interviewee distinguish true and false positives. Compute precision, recall, F1 measure?
