# Introduction

<!--
Explain why a more precise title would be "Matchmaking public procurement linked open data".
Explain why such a significant share of the dissertation is devoted to data preparation.

Contributions:

* Methods
* Tools implementing the methods (also auxiliary tools if no suitable ones are available)

## Core hypotheses

* Additional features obtained from linked open data can improve matchmaking.
* Matchmaking methods that are able to leverage textual data effectively surpass the methods that cannot.
* Improving data quality has an larger impact on matchmaking than the sophistication of matchmaking algorithms.
* Combination of semantic and statistical features of data has a synergic effect that can produce better matchmaking results than when only semantic or statistical features are used.

## Matchmaking

## Linked open data

Preliminaries

Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a graph data format for exchanging data on the Web.

(Argument for RDF, why we chose it)
RDF makes combining data straightforward.
Explicit links across datasets, for example public contracts link suppliers from a business register

## Public procurement domain

The domain of public procurement is suitable for matchmaking because, unlike many other domains, demands are made explicit in contract notices.
In many other domains only supply is explicitly described in advertising, while demand is left implicit.
Explicit formulation of demand allows us to process it automatically.
The explicit formulation is required by law to ensure a basic level of transparency and thus minimize corruption risks.

Problems of transparency:

- Matchmaking will be used only by willing civil servants.
- Corruption scandals are ignored and forgotten by the public.

## Motivation

Improving the effective allocation of public sector resources in public procurement. (Improving government's decision making)
Economies of scale
Active waste
Passive waste: passive waste proceeding from ineffieciencies dominates over active waste

Context withing the [OpenData.cz](http://opendata.cz) initiative
OpenData.cz is an initiative for transparent data infrastructure of the Czech public sector.
It advocates adopting open data and linked data principles for publishing data on the Web.
