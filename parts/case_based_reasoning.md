## Case-based reasoning

Case-based recommender systems

Using the terminology of case-based reasoning, CPV provides a "bridge attribute" that allows to derive the       similarity of contracts from the shared concepts in their descriptions.

Similarity-based retrieval
Limitation: favours larger and longer-established suppliers. <!-- An opportunity to normalize by the bidder's age from ARES? -->
Schema-aware vs. schema-agnostic matchmaking

Reinterpretation of contract award as a positive rating (in the context of the awarded contract)
Limitation: We have only positive ratings.

Case-based recommenders are usually classified as subset of knowledge-based recommenders [@Jannach2010].
