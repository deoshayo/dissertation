## Summary {#sec:data-summary}

<!--
Summarize the data preparation work done as well as key challenges encountered.

Problems:
- Missing data
- Unreliable identifiers
- Conflicting data without more annotations to identify the correct data (and resolve the conflicts)
- The data suffers from the same problems as user-generated data, since it is created by many users of the public procurement system.
- Reductive use of XML
- Violations of the allegedly validated rules
- A more detailed description of the quality of the Czech public procurement data is available in@      Soudek2016a.
