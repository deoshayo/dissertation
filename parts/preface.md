# Preface {.unnumbered}

I started with two vague assumptions driving my Ph.D.
First, linked open data can serve as a better infrastructure for online markets.
Second, matchmakers operating in this infrastructure can remove some friction from conducting business transactions in the markets, thereby making the market allocation more efficient.
What I needed to play with these ideas was a market in which data on both supply and demand is available.
Public procurement market offers a feature few other markets have: demands are explicitly represented as data in the form of public procurement notices thanks to their proactive disclosure as open data mandated by law.
Moreover, as a domain fraught with numerous data quality issues, public procurement presents a great opportunity to remedy the issues with the technologies of linked data, also known as the semantic web stack.
My work began.

I worked with linked open data on and off since 2009.
The topic I chose for my Ph.D. thus constituted a natural continuation of my prior efforts.
Late in 2010 me and my colleagues started to discuss joining the LOD2 project,^[<http://lod2.eu>] a 7^th^ Framework Programme EU research project on linked open data, which turned out to be instrumental for my Ph.D.
The project set to deliver a software stack for working with linked open data.
We proposed to extend and deploy the software for a distributed marketplace of public sector contracts published as linked open data.
Matchmaking was conceived as a key functionality operating in this marketplace to yield an economic impact of open data.
The LOD2 project funded my work from 2011 to 2014.
In 2012, in order to be able to work on the project I enrolled in the University of Economics, Prague (UEP) as a Ph.D. student and set up to pursue the goals of this dissertation.
A jigsaw falling into its place.

UEP constituted an appropriate environment to carry out my Ph.D.
The chosen dissertation topic was firmly grounded in the research direction of the Department of Information and Knowledge Engineering (DIKE) at UEP where my work was done.
My research built on both linked data and data mining, uniting the two principal areas researched at DIKE.
Linked data is a pervasive part of my work, manifest in the data preparation as well as in the SPARQL-based matchmakers.
Data mining surfaces in the application of tensor factorization via RESCAL for matchmaking.
Moreover, the overarching economic objectives motivating my Ph.D. research fit the domain targeted by UEP.
