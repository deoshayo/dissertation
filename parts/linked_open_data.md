<!-- Open data -->

Open data is data that can be accessed equally by people and machines.

<!-- Linked data -->

Linked data is a way of structuring data that identifies entities with Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRI) and materializes their relationships as a network of machine-processable data ([Ayers, 2007, p. 94](#Ayers2007)).
IRIs are universal, thus any entity can be identified with a IRI, and have global scope, therefore IRI can only identify one entity ([Berners-Lee, 1996](#BernersLee1996)).

Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a graph data format for exchanging data on the Web.

(Argument for RDF, why we chose it)
RDF makes combining data straightforward.
Explicit links across datasets, for example public contracts link suppliers from a business register

Linked open data offers interoperability without centralization.

* Open world assumption (OWA)
* Anyone can say anything about anything (AAA)

The benefits of using linked open data are demonstrated mostly in the data preparation.
Linked open data makes it simpler to combine multiple datasets.
It also provides a way to define "semantic" features for matchmaking.
Semantic features can alleviate the problem of "shallow content analysis" that exists in some content-based recommender systems, typically those based on text.
