Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a graph data format for exchanging data on the Web.

(Argument for RDF, why we chose it)
RDF makes combining data straightforward.
Explicit links across datasets, for example public contracts link suppliers from a business register

Linked open data offers interoperability without centralization.
