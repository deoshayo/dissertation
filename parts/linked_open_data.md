## Linked open data

Linked open data (LOD) is the intersection of open and linked data.
It combines proactive disclosure of open data, which is unencumbered by restrictions to access and use, with linked data, which provides a model for publishing semantic structured data on the Web.
LOD serves as a fundamental component of our work that enables matchmaking to be executed.
