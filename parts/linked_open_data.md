## Linked open data

Linked open data (LOD) is the intersection of open and linked data.
It combines proactive disclosure of data, which is unencumbered by access restrictions, with linked data, which provides a publication model for structured data on the Web.
It serves as a fundamental component of our work that enables matchmaking to be executed.
