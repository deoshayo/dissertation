## Linked open data

Linked open data is the intersection of open and linked data.
It combines proactive disclosure of data, unencumbered by access restrictions, with linked data, which provides a knowledge technology and a publication model for structured data on the Web.
It serves as a fundamental component of our work that enables matchmaking to be executed.
