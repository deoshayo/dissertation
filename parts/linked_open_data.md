Linked data is a way of structuring data that identifies entities with Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRI) and materializes their relationships as a network of machine-processable data ([Ayers, 2007, p. 94](#Ayers2007)).
IRIs are universal, thus any entity can be identified with a IRI, and have global scope, therefore IRI can only identify one entity ([Berners-Lee, 1996](#BernersLee1996)).

Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a graph data format for exchanging data on the Web.

(Argument for RDF, why we chose it)
RDF makes combining data straightforward.
Explicit links across datasets, for example public contracts link suppliers from a business register

Linked open data offers interoperability without centralization.

Non-unique name assumption (nUNA)
Open world assumption (OWA): anyone can say anything about anything (AAA)
