### Open data

Open data is data that can be accessed equally by people and machines.

<!-- Explain the Open definition -->

While releasing open data is frequently framed as a means to improve transparency of the public sector, it can also have a positive effect on its efficiency ([Access Info Europe, Open Knowledge Foundation, p. 69](#AccessInfoEurope2011)), since the public sector itself is often the primary user of open data.
Using open data can help streamline public sector processes ([Parycek, Höchtl, Ginner, 2014, p. 90](#Parycek2014)) and curb unnecessary expenditures ([Prešern, Žejn, 2014, p. 4](#Presern2014)).
The publication of public procurement data is claimed to improve *"the quality of government investment decision-making"* ([Kenny, Karver, 2012, p. 2](#Kenny2012)), as supervision enabled by access to data puts a pressure on contracting authorities to follow fair and budget-wise contracting procedures.
Matchmaking public contracts to relevant suppliers is an example of such application that can contribute to better informed decisions that lead to more economically advantageous contracts.

Benefits:

* avoiding asymmetric distribution of information

Open data can balance information asymmetries between the members of the market caused by fragmentation of data distributed on the Web.
Better informedness can then lead to better decisions of the market's participants.
A key step in this direction is better integration of data on the Web.

Context withing the [OpenData.cz](http://opendata.cz) initiative
OpenData.cz is an initiative for transparent data infrastructure of the Czech public sector.
It advocates adopting open data and linked data principles for publishing data on the Web.
