## Public procurement domain

The domain of public procurement is suitable for matchmaking because, unlike many other domains, demands are made explicit in contract notices.
In many other domains only supply is explicitly described in advertising, while demand is left implicit.
Explicit formulation of demand allows us to process it automatically.
The explicit formulation is required by law to ensure a basic level of transparency and thus minimize corruption risks.

Problems of transparency:

- Matchmaking will be used only by willing civil servants.
- Corruption scandals are ignored and forgotten by the public.

Legal basis of proactive disclosure of public procurement data.
